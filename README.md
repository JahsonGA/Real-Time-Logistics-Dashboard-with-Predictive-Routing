<p id="description">This is a personal project I’ve been building—a real-time dashboard for managing delivery fleets. It pulls in live GPS data, predicts ETAs using machine learning, and suggests alternate routes when things get delayed. It also uses a full CI/CD pipeline running on Kubernetes. My goal is to bring together everything I’ve been learning about data, real-time systems, and cloud deployment into one clean, working app.</p>

<h1><strong>Scope and Requirements</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Goals</strong></h2>
Build a dashboard that shows:

*   Live vehicle tracking (GPS-based)
*   Delivery status updates (e.g. route delayed)
*   Predictive routing suggestions (e.g. based on traffic weather or past delivery times)

<h2><strong>Use Cases</strong></h2>
Logistics managers at a delivery company use the dashboard to:

*  Monitor fleets
*  Identify delays
*  Optimize routes in real-time

<h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>

| Feature               | Description                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Real-time vehicle map | Live updating map showing current vehicle positions              |
| Delivery status       | Timeline/status updates of packages (picked up, delivered, etc.) |
| Predictive routing    | Suggestions to improve ETAs using ML                             |
| Historical data       | View past routes, delays, and performance metrics                |

<h1><strong>Architecture Planning</strong></h1>

| Layer           | Tools                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend        | React, Leaflet.js or Mapbox GL JS for maps, Recharts/D3.js for graphs |
| Backend         | Node.js with Express or Python with FastAPI                           |
| Real-Time Layer | Socket.IO or WebSockets                                               |
| Database        | PostgreSQL + PostGIS or MongoDB (for spatial data)                    |
| ML              | Scikit-learn or TensorFlow for prediction models                      |
| DevOps          | Docker, GitHub Actions, Vercel/Render/AWS/GCP                         |

<h1><strong>Data Simulation or Collection</strong></h1>

*  Real-time GPS data (e.g., vehicle ID, lat/lng, speed, timestamp)
*  Delivery route history (for predictive ML)

<h1><strong>Predictive Routing ML Model</strong></h1>
The model is trained on actual delivery durations and delays. Given the time of day, location, traffic, weather, and historical delivery time, the model can predict the:

* Estimated time of arrival (ETA)
* Likelihood of delay
* Best alternative route

<h1><strong>Dashboard Design</strong></h1>
Includes:

*  Real-time map panel
*  Searchable delivery list
*  Route recommendation panel
*  Delay alerts

<h1><strong>Contact and Bugs</strong></h1>
I am learning as I go. If you come across a bug, please open an issue. I will do my best to stay on top of debugging as I can. If you are interested in helping or have a question about this project, ping me on GitHub.
