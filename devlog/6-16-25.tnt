Started work on structure of the app and set up for API_KEY. The plan for the backend is:
[ MTA API ] --> [ Your Backend ] --> [ WebSocket Server ] --> [ React Dashboard ]

The backend will be responsible for the following features
-   Pulls data every 15â€“30 seconds using setInterval or a scheduled job
-   Parses bus locations (lat/lng, vehicle ref, timestamp, status)
-   Broadcasts clean JSON via WebSocket to all connected clients
