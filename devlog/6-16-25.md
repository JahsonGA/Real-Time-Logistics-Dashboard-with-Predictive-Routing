Started work on structure of the app and set up for API_KEY. The plan for the backend is:
[ MTA API ] --> [ Your Backend ] --> [ WebSocket Server ] --> [ React Dashboard ]

The backend will be responsible for the following features
-   Pulls data every 15â€“30 seconds using setInterval or a scheduled job
-   Parses bus locations (lat/lng, vehicle ref, timestamp, status)
-   Broadcasts clean JSON via WebSocket to all connected clients

What I have to learn more about
| Task                           | Concept                                      |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Interfacing with 3rd-party API | API authentication, HTTP clients             |
| Data parsing                   | JSON traversal, data sanitization            |
| Backend polling                | Interval jobs, rate limits                   |
| Real-time updates              | WebSockets (Node.js + `ws` or Socket.IO)     |
| Map rendering                  | Mapbox or Leaflet integration                |
| Spatial reasoning              | Plotting moving objects, handling stale data |

Current Goal is to:
-   request data every 15 seconds
    -   limit what data is requested 
    -   save JSON of data

-   Create solution for timeout and dropped connections
-   Add logging to track requests
